							<h3>Mindset</h3>
							<p>In the fast paced world of tomorrow, learning won't be a defined phase anymore, it will be a lifestyle. This is why I belive in a hands-on aproach to learning. We must understand how to Search, Filter, Absorb and Display all the information avaiable online in order to keep up and provide value to the dynamic world of the future.</p>
							<h3>Information Technology</h3>
							<p>Information Technology is something I've always been passionate about, specially the Internet, which I belive is one of the most powerful tools created in the history of Humanity. The Internet is connecting the world and IT is taking over almost every aspect of our life, creating an unlimited amount of potential and opportunities. </p>
							<h3>Economics</h3>
							<p>According to Wikipedia, Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. I think this only scratches the surface. Done right, economics is an extremely powerful predictor of behaviour. By analyzing the system and "gaming" it's incentives you can calculate, often with precision, the most likely outcome.</p>
							<p>IT & Economics are my best tools, naturally I love BlockChains. Follow me for this type of content!</p>

						<article id="blockchain">
							<h2 class="major">Blockchain</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Definition</h3>
							<p>A blockchain is a database of transactions that is updated and shared across many computers (Nodes) in a network. This network is Peer to Peer so everyone is allowed to join and receive a full copy of the Blockchain to verify with its own Node if the BlockChain is secure. Every time a transaction occurs, it gets stored in a block. When a block fills up, a new block must be mine to expand the database storage capacity - hence the name blockchain. </p>
							<h3>Mining</h3>
							<p>Mining works different depending on the BlockChain network, but essentially you need to resolve an equation involving the new Data, the Previous Block Identifier Number (Hash) and the New Hash. This way if someone wanted to change the information of an old block, all blocks after that would become corrupt and that miner would be isolated from the network. And if someone wanted to mine a new block with fake Data, they'd need to do so with the majority of computing power on the network.</p>
							<h3>Typical BlockChain Advantages</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><h5>Decentralized</h5></li>
									<li><h5>Secure</h5></li>
									<li><h5>Inmutable</h5></li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Typical BlockChain Disadvantages</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><h5>Hard to Scale</h5></li>
									<li><h5>Complex</h5></li>
									<li><h5>Experimental</h5></li>
								</ul>

						<!-- Values -->
						<article id="values">
							<h2 class="major">Values</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Principles</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><h5>The individual as the center of moral principles.</h5></li>
								<li><h5>Freedom and decentralization of power.</h5></li>
								<li><h5>Time is the ultime currency.</h5></li>
							</ul>
						<!--
							<h3>Life Philosophy</h3>
							<p>I follow the Non Aggression Principle which means I belive attacking or lying are the two most moralally wrong actions a person could do and that violence is only justified, as a last resort, in self defense.</p>
						-->
							<h3>Mission</h3>							
							<p>Technology has put in an unique moment of history. The standards we set today will affect humanity for years to come. I belive Decentralized Finance plays a key role in the future of civilization. Money should belong to the people and be free (as in freedom) and not controlled by a small (and getting smaller every day) group of unelected burocrats/bankers. I truly belive the liberation of money will precipitate a period of inanimaginable growth and prosperity.</p>

								<h4>Everything is Connected</h4>
								<p>Your life choices are far more important than you think. Over your lifetime you'll (for sure) meet more than 2000 persons and those 2000 persons will meet another 2000 persons. This means that as a person, you are a node in a Network. Whatever your signal is, it's three persons away from impacting the entire Human-Race in ways you cannot even comprehend. </p>
								<h4>Build Yourself</h4>
								<p>Because of this connection, there is a moral imperative and an individual incentive, to be the chage you want to see in the world by becoming the best version of yourself. Act in a fair, honest and reciprocal way. Build this network by connecting with each other and trying our best to help.</p>
								<h4>Let's Connect!</h4>
